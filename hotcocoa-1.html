           <p> Cocoa – The Latin name for cocoa—Theobroma—literally means, “Food of the gods.”
            
            Fibre – each OG Gourmet Hot Cocoa provides 2.8gr of fibre per serving.
            
            Ganoderma – also known as the red Reishi mushroom, this mild flavour adds a note of depth to the cocoa flavour.
            
            Ganoderma has been used in traditional Asian culture for thousands of years. The name Ganoderma means “spiritual potency”, while the Japanese name Reishi can be translated as “King of Herbs”.
            
            Malt Extract – Malt extract helps give the OG Gourmet Hot Cocoa an ‘old fashioned’ cocoa flavour.
            
            Organo™ Gourmet Hot Cocoa provides cocoa with ganoderma and naturally contains fibre.</p>
