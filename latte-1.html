            <h3>KEY INGREDIENTS</h3>
           <p> Arabica and Robusta coffee -- Arabica, the finest, richest coffee beans in the world, provide a sweet-soft flavor. Unroasted, the beans give off a blueberry-like aroma that turns into fruity/floral taste in the roasting process. The beans are grown in cool, subtropical climates at higher altitudes than most other coffee beans. Less common than Arabica, Robusta beans are grown at a lower altitude and offer a less-sweet, bolder flavor to the coffee mix. Mostly commonly, Robusta beans are used to make rich, complex espresso.</p>

            You can also add ice for a creamy cool cocoa treat. </p>
